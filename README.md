Pells-Equation-Solver
=====================

This program will produce the Nth solution to Pell's Equation, for d = 2.
See [Pell's Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pell%27s_equation "Pell's (General) Equation").

There is a unique property for the solutions of Pell's Equation for d = 2, which makes iterative computation much easier than having to perform
the repeated exponential multiplications. This is an implementation of this more simple method.
